              As a software developer, coding is a big part of what I do. On
              this page you'll see some of my recent and ongoing coding
              projects, both personal and professional. This includes things

              code is available publicly for you to review and learn from. I'm

              I started programming as a hobby during my college years and
              quickly discovered a passion for it. After getting my Computer
              Science degree, I went on to build my career in the tech industry.
              This about page provides a brief overview of my background and
              experience as a full stack developer. You can learn more about my
              technical skills, education, interests outside of coding, and
              overall goals for the future.
